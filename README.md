personalized campaigns during peak months (e.g., January and September) to maximize trends.

2. Enhance Customer Engagement: 
Revitalize Content Strategy: Improve declining views and interaction rates by experimenting with engaging formats like interactive videos or user-generated content. Optimize call-to-action placement in social media and blog posts, especially during low-engagement months (August to December).

4. Improve Customer Feedback Scores: 
Address Mixed and Negative Feedback: Create a feedback loop to analyze mixed and negative reviews for recurring issues. Develop action plans to resolve these concerns, follow up with dissatisfied customers to address their issues, and encourage re-rating to help raise the average rating closer to the 4.0 target.
